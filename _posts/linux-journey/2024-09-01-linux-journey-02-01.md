# Linux Journey 

# 02. Text-Fu PART I 

# Important: 


My goal here is to fully understand what I am doing with Linux. Over the years I noticed that I learn best, if I document it and try to explain it to myself in different words. 
I know that the webpage https://linuxjourney.com/ is already written for beginners never the less I want to rephrase, document and repeat the commands here. 

My summary may not be complete so I would recomment you that you actually learn Linux from https://linuxjourney.com/ yourself :-) 


## 2.1 stdout (Standard Out)

In Linux, stdout (standard output) is the place where a program sends its output. By default, this is your terminal or console screen.

Examples:
- Displays "Hello World" to the terminal.

```bash
echo "Hello World
```

- redirect stdout to a file
```bash
echo "Hello World!" > output.txt
```

- Append stdout to a file (adding line without erasing the original content)
```bash
echo "Hello World!" >> output.txt
```

## 2.2 stdin (Standard In)

We can input with keyboard or for example a file. Very useful is that redirect from a file. 

```bash
echo < input.txt
```

## 2.3 sterr (Standard Error)

What about errors? In this example the error has its default output in the terminal instead in our file. 
```bash
root@PREDATOR-01:/home# ls fake/directory >test2.txt
ls: cannot access 'fake/directory': No such file or directory
```

But we can redirect it into a file when we know how. 

 You can redirect stderr to a file using `2>` because 2 represents stderr (just like 1 represents stdout):


```bash
root@PREDATOR-01:/home# ls fake/directory 2>test2.txt
root@PREDATOR-01:/home# cat test2.txt
ls: cannot access 'fake/directory': No such file or directory
```

What if we want both? Write the error into the file and display it on the screen? Lets try it with following command:
`2>&1` or `&>`
```
ls fake/directory 2>&1 test2.txt
ls: cannot access 'fake/directory': No such file or directory
test2.txt
```

And if you want to get rid of `stderr`completly? You can redirect the error messsages into the linux build-in black hole `/dev/null`

Example: 
```bash
root@PREDATOR-01:/home# ls fake/directory 2>/dev/null
root@PREDATOR-01:/home#
```

All error messages are gone :-) 


## 2.4 pipe and tee

Lets say we check the contents of `/etc`.

`ls -la /etc`

And we get a very long list of items. But with `pipes` we can redirect the output to a file or another command.

`root@PREDATOR-01:/home# ls -la /etc | head`

This is very useful and you will use it everytime on a linux system.

With `tee` you can redirect the output to two different streams. For example:


```bash

root@PREDATOR-01:/home# ls -la /etc | head | tee test3.txt
total 704
drwxr-xr-x 73 root root    4096 Sep  5 15:10 .
drwxr-xr-x 19 root root    4096 Sep  5 14:46 ..
-rw-------  1 root root       0 Nov 23  2023 .pwd.lock
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root    4096 Nov 23  2023 PackageKit
drwxr-xr-x  4 root root    4096 Nov 23  2023 X11
-rw-r--r--  1 root root    3028 Nov 23  2023 adduser.conf
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root    4096 Aug 22 20:26 alternatives
drwxr-xr-x  3 root root    4096 Nov 23  2023 apparmor
drwxr-xr-x  8 root root    4096 Aug 22 20:26 apparmor.d
root@PREDATOR-01:/home# cat test3.txt
total 704
drwxr-xr-x 73 root root    4096 Sep  5 15:10 .
drwxr-xr-x 19 root root    4096 Sep  5 14:46 ..
-rw-------  1 root root       0 Nov 23  2023 .pwd.lock
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root    4096 Nov 23  2023 PackageKit
drwxr-xr-x  4 root root    4096 Nov 23  2023 X11
-rw-r--r--  1 root root    3028 Nov 23  2023 adduser.conf
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root    4096 Aug 22 20:26 alternatives
drwxr-xr-x  3 root root    4096 Nov 23  2023 apparmor
drwxr-xr-x  8 root root    4096 Aug 22 20:26 apparmor.d

```
Do you see it? I redirect the output from `ls` to show me just the first 10 lines with `head` and redirect those 10 lines to output on the screen and also into my file **test3.txt**.

## 2.5 env (Environment)

Perhaps you heard about `environment variables`? No? Okay, lets say the variables contain useful information that a program or shell can use. 

One of the most important variables is the `PATH` Variable. In there is a list of paths that the system searches when it runs a command!

Lets see ours:

with `echo $PATH` we can see a long list of paths. Sometimes its necessary to add/modify entries there.

## 2.6 cut

The cut command in Linux is used to extract specific sections from lines of text. It works particularly well when data is organized into columns or fields.

- this cuts the characters from position 1-5 so the output is `Hello`
```bash
root@PREDATOR-01:/home# echo "Hello, World!" | cut -c 1-5
Hello
```
- You can use `-d` to specify a delimiter (like a comma or space) and `-f` to specify which field(s) you want

```bash
root@PREDATOR-01:/home# echo "apple,banana,cherry" | cut -d ',' -f 2
banana
```


### The next commands will be in Part 2.
