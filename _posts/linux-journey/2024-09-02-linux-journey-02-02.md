# Linux Journey 

# 02. Text-Fu PART II 

# Important: 


My goal here is to fully understand what I am doing with Linux. Over the years I noticed that I learn best, if I document it and try to explain it to myself in different words. 
I know that the webpage https://linuxjourney.com/ is already written for beginners never the less I want to rephrase, document and repeat the commands here. 

My summary may not be complete so I would recomment you that you actually learn Linux from https://linuxjourney.com/ yourself :-) 


## 2.7 paste 


`paste` is very similar to `cat`. It merges lines together in a file. Example:

```bash
root@PREDATOR-01:/home/linux_journey# cat test.txt
apples
pears
pineapples
bananas
strawberries
cherries
root@PREDATOR-01:/home/linux_journey# paste -s test.txt
apples  pears   pineapples      bananas strawberries    cherries
root@PREDATOR-01:/home/linux_journey#
```

As you can see, after using `paste -s` merged the lines which were seperated. 

With `-d` we can change the delimiter to something else. For example `Spaces`

```bash
paste -d " " -s test.txt
```
## 2.8 head 


Very important to get a short preview of a large file. `head` shows just the first `10 lines`. It is very useful if you combine `head` with `pipes` or `tee`. If you want to have for example 20 lines you can use the flag `-n Number of lines`. 

Example: 
`head /var/log/syslog`
`head -n 20 /var/log/syslog`

## 2.9 tail

Very similar to `head`. You get the last 10 lines by default. You can also change via the flag `-n` the lines you want to see. Very nice as an Linux Administrator is the flag `-f`. It shows you everything that is getting added to that file.

`root@PREDATOR-01:/home/linux_journey# tail -f /var/log/syslog`


## 2.10 join and split

With `join` we can merge multiple files together by a common field.

Example:

```bash
root@PREDATOR-01:/home/linux_journey# cat test.txt test1.txt
1 apples
2 pears
3 pineapples
4 bananas
5 strawberries

1 monday
2 tuesday
3 wednesday
4 thursday
5 friday
root@PREDATOR-01:/home/linux_journey# join test.txt test1.txt
1 apples monday
2 pears tuesday
3 pineapples wednesday
4 bananas thursday
5 strawberries friday

```
They are joined by the common field `1,2,3,4,5`. 
 
 We can split now via `split` into lines or bytes. You get files names `xaa, xab` and so on.
```bash
 root@PREDATOR-01:/home/linux_journey# cat xaa
1 apples monday
2 pears tuesday

```


## 2.11 sort

This command is very useful for sorting and changing big text files. I make an example:

```bash
root@PREDATOR-01:/home/linux_journey# cat sort-test.txt
Thomas
Albert
Chris
Franz
Jeff
Richard
Elon
Tony
root@PREDATOR-01:/home/linux_journey# sort sort-test.txt
Albert
Chris
Elon
Franz
Jeff
Richard
Thomas
Tony
root@PREDATOR-01:/home/linux_journey#
```

By default the `sort` command sorts the content alphabetically. It is also possible to `sort` in other ways.

#### Common Flags:

- `-n` sorts numbers 
- `-r` sorts descending alphabetically
- `-k` sorts lines based on a specified field (column)
- `-u` removes duplicates lines from the output 


## 2.12 tr (Translate)

This command allows you to translate characters into other characters. 

Example:

```bash
TR(1)                                               User Commands                                               TR(1)

NAME
       tr - translate or delete characters

SYNOPSIS
       tr [OPTION]... SET1 [SET2]

root@PREDATOR-01:/home/linux_journey# cat test.txt
test hello test
root@PREDATOR-01:/home/linux_journey# cat test.txt | tr "a-z" "A-Z"
TEST HELLO TEST
```

## 2.13 uniq (Unique) 

`uniq` is similar to `sort` and very useful when used together. `uniq`only identifies duplicates if the lines are adjacent. 

Good ways to use both commands:

```bash
root@PREDATOR-01:/home/linux_journey# cat sort-test.txt
Chris
Chris
Chris
Thomas
Chris
Franz
root@PREDATOR-01:/home/linux_journey# sort sort-test.txt | uniq
Chris
Franz
Thomas
root@PREDATOR-01:/home/linux_journey#
```
After sorting via `sort` we could delete all duplicates from the file.

with `-c` we can count, how often the duplicates appear: 

```bash
root@PREDATOR-01:/home/linux_journey# sort sort-test.txt | uniq -c
      4 Chris
      1 Franz
      1 Thomas
```

other good flags: 
- `-d` show only lines that appear more than once
- `-i` ignores upper and lowercatter and treats them as the same
- `-w`check X characters for uniqueness

## 2.14 wc and nl (word count and number lines)

Wordcount `wc` shows the total count of words in a file:
```bash
/home/linux_journey# wc sort-test.txt
 6  6 37 sort-test.txt
 ```
It display the number of lines, number of words and number of bytes, respectively.

To just see just the count of a certain field, use the `-l`, `-w`, or `-c` respectively.

With `nl` you can count lines.

```bash
root@PREDATOR-01:/home/linux_journey# nl sort-test.txt
     1  Chris
     2  Chris
     3  Chris
     4  Thomas
     5  Chris
     6  Franz
```
## 2.15 grep

`grep` is probably my most used text processing command. It allows to search files for character that matches a pattern. 

Example:
```bash
root@PREDATOR-01:/home/linux_journey# grep Th sort-test.txt
Thomas
```
I searched here for "Th` and found Thomas. Very very useful.

It works also very good for completly different tasks, for example finding a service.

```bash
root@PREDATOR-01:/home/linux_journey# systemctl |grep -i netw
  networkd-dispatcher.service
                                                    loaded active running   Dispatcher daemon for systemd-networkd
```


I searched in my services for "netw" and found the networkd service. With `-i` I ignore upper/lower letters. (Case sensitive)
