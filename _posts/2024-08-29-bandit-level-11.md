### Level 11

**Username:** `bandit11`  
**Password:** `dtR173fZKb0RRsDFSGsg2RWnpNVj3qRr`

### Task:

<!-- PICTURE FROM TASK -->
https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit12.html

    The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions

    Commands you may need to solve this level
    grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd

### Start

Let's begin by connecting to the server `bandit.labs.overthewire.org` and logging in with user `bandit11` on port `2220`.

We have several commands available for this task:


    man (1)              - an interface to the system reference manuals
    grep (1)             - print lines that match patterns
    sort (1)             - sort lines of text files
    uniq (1)             - report or omit repeated lines
    strings (1)          - print the sequences of printable characters in files
    base64 (1)           - base64 encode/decode data and print to standard output
    tr (1)               - translate or delete characters
    tar (1)              - an archiving utility
    gzip (1)             - compress or expand files
    bzip2 (1)            - a block-sorting file compressor, v1.0.8
    xxd (1)              - make a hex dump or do the reverse.

### Solve the level

Okay I think we have to do a little research on `Rot13`. 

![wiki](assets/img/Bandit_11/Bandit_11_1.png "wiki")

This helpful table is a good visual what we have to do here. We have to translate the letters 13 positions back. The `tr`command looks like the correct choice here. Lets check the manual.

The manual is a little bit difficult to understand here:

```bash

NAME
       tr - translate or delete characters

SYNOPSIS
       tr [OPTION]... STRING1 [STRING2]

DESCRIPTION
       Translate,  squeeze, and/or delete characters from standard input, writing to standard output.  STRING1 and STRING2 specify arrays of characters ARRAY1 and
       ARRAY2 that control the action.


``` 

What is meant with that? 
- **OPTION** Optional flags 
- **STRING1**  is the set of characters what we want to translate/delete.
- **STRING2** is the set of characters we want to translate into


For ROT13 encoding or decoding, you use `tr` to map each letter of the alphabet to its counterpart 13 positions ahead. 

We use **STRING1** for our characters, what we want:

`"A-Za-z"`          is our alphabet with upper and lower letters

We use **STRING2** for our characters, what we want replaced with:
`"N-ZA-Mn-za-m"`    is the ROT13 alphabet, check the picture above. The upper alphabet goes "N-Z + A-M" and the lower alphabet goes "n-z + a-m".



Lets take all this in one command:

```bash
bandit11@bandit:~$ cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
The password is 7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4
```

We send the ouput of the data.txt file into the "translator" with our prefered translation and get the password as output :joy: 

Password: `7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4`

## Explanation: 
#### Substitution Ciphers

Substitution involves replacing one character with another. Substitution ciphers, such as the Caesar and Vigen√®re ciphers, have been used for a long time but are no longer considered secure.

The ROT13 cipher, a simple substitution cipher, rotates letters by 13 positions in the alphabet. This is particularly interesting because, with a 26-letter Latin alphabet, the encryption algorithm is the same as the decryption algorithm.

In Linux, the `tr` command, which stands for 'translate', is used for character replacement. The basic syntax for `tr` is:

```bash
tr <old_chars> <new_chars>
