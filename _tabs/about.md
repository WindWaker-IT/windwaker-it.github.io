# IT-Specialist Chris 

**Welcome to my blog!!** 


Hi, I’m Chris! I’m 29 years old and grew up in Munich. My passion for computers started at the age of 5, initially with video games, but over time, I became fascinated by how devices and programs actually work.

After completing my German **Ausbildung** in 2020, I began working for a managed server provider specializing in fully managed services for small to medium-sized businesses. I’m grateful for the opportunity to have spent several years there, learning something new every day.

During this time, I gained extensive experience in server infrastructure, networks, virtualization, IT security, and more. Below are some key areas I’ve developed expertise in:

---

### Microsoft Server Management
Setting up, configuring, and maintaining Microsoft Server environments:
- Optimizing server performance
- Ensuring security compliance
- Server hardening
- Planning new server infrastructures for customers

### Virtualization
Managing virtual machine environments to enhance scalability and operational efficiency:
- Experience with various VM platforms
- Supporting and streamlining IT operations
- Administering multiple vSphere farms

### Backup Infrastructure
Designing and implementing backup solutions to safeguard critical data. I earned my Veeam Certified Engineer certification last year:
- Developing backup plans with RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective) in mind
- Setting up reliable backup systems
- Creating disaster recovery plans
- Consulting customers and inspecting infrastructures

### Server Projects
Involved in numerous server-related projects, from initial setup to ongoing management:
- Strong understanding of server architecture
- Hands-on experience in server operations and project management

---

### Hardware
Deploying, replacing, and repairing server and client hardware, with certification in Lenovo devices:
- Replacing various hardware components in servers, storage systems (SAN, NAS), and client devices
- In-depth knowledge of how hardware functions

## Transitioning to Cybersecurity

Over the past few years, I’ve developed a growing interest in cybersecurity. Here are some of the areas I’ve been focusing on:
- Managing and administering IDS systems
- Working with several SIEM tools and responding to incidents
- Analyzing malware behavior

### Certifications:
- **Google Cybersecurity Certificate**: A beginner-friendly certification that provided valuable foundational knowledge

---

## What’s Next:

- **Linux Certification (LPIC-1 and LPIC-2)**: I’m currently working toward Linux certifications and honing my skills with [Linux Journey](https://linuxjourney.com/). I also practice in Wargames and CTF challenges.
- **Linux Wargames and CTF Challenges**: I enjoy tackling challenges to sharpen my Linux and penetration testing skills.
- **Programming (Python)**: While I have a solid grasp of scripting and programming, I aim to improve my ability to write more complex algorithms and programs.

This site is where I document my journey and share insights from my experiences with CTF challenges. I’m passionate about both offensive and defensive security techniques!
